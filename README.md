Folders 01-09 are bioinformatic processing and filtering for taking raw data to filtered VCF (mostly using GATK best practices). Folder 10 is where the majority of data analysis is stored. Folder 11 contains scripts for IBM to test effecft of genetic drift. 

Raw data is available at NCBI SRA bioproject [PRJNA995528 : Great Lakes Pink Salmon Evolution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA995528)

Unfiltered VCF is available at:
